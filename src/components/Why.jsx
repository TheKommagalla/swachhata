                                In the current municipal waste management system, many cities still rely on manual processes and outdated methods. Waste collection is often irregular, with no real-time tracking or communication between citizens and municipal staff. Residents have limited ways to raise complaints or request missed pickups, leading to unattended garbage and unhygienic surroundings. The lack of digital infrastructure makes the system inefficient, slow to respond, and difficult to monitor or optimize

                                    <p className= ' mt-3 p-2 mb-0 description' >
                                   Moreover, there is minimal citizen engagement or awareness about proper waste segregation and recycling practices. Most systems operate in isolation without smart routing, real-time notifications, or efficient feedback loops. This results in mismanagement, increased operational costs, and a negative impact on public health and the environment. The need for a smart, transparent, and technology-driven approach to tackle these challenges is more urgent than ever
